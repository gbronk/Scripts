# Scripts
MATLAB and Python Scripts by Gabriel Bronk: Selected Scripts from Journal Articles by Bronk and Educational Scripts for College/High School Lessons 

Below, I list the scripts that I have posted to my GitHub. If you have any questions or would like to see scripts from my research that I have not posted, please email me at gbronk AT brandeis.edu

1) IntroductionToModelingChromosomesWithFreelyJointedChain.m
  This MATLAB code simulates a random conformation of the arm of a chromosome 
  in a yeast cell's nucleus. This script is intended for any researcher who 
  wishes to learn how to model a chromosome in a simple manner. It is also
  useful for teaching college (or advanced high school) students how to
  create a simple Monte Carlo simulation.
  
2) ModelingChromosomeWithFreelyJointedChainFastAlgorithm.m
  This MATLAB code simulates a random conformation of the arm of a chromosome 
  in a yeast cell's nucleus, and it uses an algorithm I developed in order to 
  reduce the computation time compared to doing a regular random walk chromosome simulation.
  This script is intended for any researcher who wishes to model a chromosome in a simple 
  manner and wants to reduce the computation time. This FAST ALGORITHM is useful for
  simulating a freely-jointed chain chromosome that is confined to a 
  certain region and/or attached to certain locations. I developed this algorithm 
  for the paper "Chromosome-refolding model of mating-type
  switching in yeast" published in PNAS in 2016 by Avaroglu, Bronk, et al.
  The algorithm is described in the paper's Supplementary Information under
  the heading "Polymer Model Simulation Details."
  
 3) IntroductionToMachineLearningWithPython.py
   This Python code loads patient data (physiological measurements from the ICU) and uses 
   it to predict whether patients will get sepsis. This code is inteded for teaching college 
   or advanced high school students how to do machine learning (using the specific machine
   learning example of a generalized linear model).
